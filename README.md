### What is OpenDev?

OpenDev is a personal variant of OpenCode, an open source AI coding agent that runs in your
terminal. It builds on the OpenCode codebase with local modifications and configuration tuned
for the way I work.

For the full upstream feature set, documentation, and community, see
[**OpenCode**](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) and its docs at [**opencode.ai**](https://opencode.ai/docs).

### Installation

OpenDev runs from source with [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the dev server
bun dev

#if you want to, you can build it too

bun build ./src/index.ts --compile --outfile ./dist/OpenDev.exe
```

For upstream binary installs (the unmodified OpenCode), see the
[official installer](https://opencode.ai/install).

### Documentation

OpenDev is configured in the same way as OpenCode. For how OpenCode is configured, head over to the upstream docs at
[**opencode.ai/docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).

### Contributing

This is a personal project, but contributions are welcome
